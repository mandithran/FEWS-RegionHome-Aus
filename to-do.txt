Agenda:
- FEWS
  - Output
  - Lower resolution alongshore?

To-do:
- Apply for long-term storage
- Tidy up pre-processing code and model run code 
- See if you can get file size reduced by reducing outputs
- Run entire workflow from a script - begin automation process (make meta-workflow)
- Long-term storage and automate to dump runs and inputs there (https://www.dataarchive.unsw.edu.au/help/command-line-script-guide)
- Automate - get runs running for Narrabeen all the time with a script, wipe / purge older files (https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/FEWSDOC/03+Setting+Up+Scheduled+Forecasts)
- Double-check that all inputs make sense (param values and input time series, e.g. astronomical tides - MHL website)
- Double-check that outputs make sense* 
- Double-check that spin-up times all match up for inputs and time series inputs
- Turn morphology off for now - look at wave run up via gauges
- Narra Grid - extend boundaries and lower resolution? - 7 day forecast window
- Workflow for post-processing run-up gauges (which turn into TWL lines)
- Workflow for post-processing erosion scarp
- Workflow for visualizing outputs in FEWS
- Workflow for turning morphology on/off
- Mandurah grid and trial runs
- Visualize inputs properly (get FEWS to only show the next few days for waves/tides/surge)
- Validation of the prototype EWS
