#================ RUNNING THE MODULE ================#

This is an external FEWS module that fetches storm surge grids from the BOM server. It can be run directly from FEWS in manual forecast mode.

If you try to run the module and it throws an error about the file not being found, your system time in FEWS is probably too recent. There is a lag between the time indicated for the forecasts and the time the file is uploaded to the server.

To fix this, set back the sytem time to 6 hours earlier from "Now" in FEWS.

All python errors from this module will be sent to .\NSSDownload\diagnostics.txt


#================ DEBUGGING AND EDITING THE MODULE ================#

Debugging and editing this module requires setting up virtualenv.

Once virtualenv is installed:

1. Open terminal or command line and navigate to the following directory within your "Region Home" (where the FEWS program is located): $REGION_HOME$/Modules/SurgeDownload/python

2. Re-activate the existing virtual environment by entering the following line into a terminal or command prompt: 

.\bin\fews-venv\Scripts\Activate

This will create a virtual environment in the bin/fews-venv directory.

3. Debug, set-up and install any packages as needed.

4. Once done, save the dependencies into a requirements.txt file:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

5. When you've made the necessary modifications, zip up the Module directory and place it in the ModuleDataSetFiles directory.
